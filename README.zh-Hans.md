## 重要术语(Important Terminology) 

<a name="terms-level-map"></a>

##### 关卡(Levels)/地图(Maps)

"Map(地图)" 这个词通常也会被称为"Level(关卡)", 两者的含义时等同的.在[这里](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_(video_gaming))可以查看这个此的发展历史.

The word 'map' generally refers to what the average person calls a 'level' and may be used interchangeably. See this term's history [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_(video_gaming)).

<a name="terms-identifiers"></a>

##### 命名

##### Identifiers

`命名(Identifiers)` 是任何类似或充当"名称"的东西. 列入,一个资产的名字,或者一个材质的名称, 一个蓝图属性, 一个变量, 一个文件夹,或者一个数据表的行名,等等...


An `Identifier` is anything that resembles or serves as a "name". For example, the name of an asset, or the name of a material later, or a blueprint property, a variable, or a folder name, or for a data table row name, etc...

<a name="terms-cases"></a>

##### 大小写

##### Cases

对于字母的大小写的规范有数种, 以下是常见的几种

There are a few different ways you can `CaseWordsWhenNaming`. Here are some common casing types:


> ###### PascalCase
>
> Capitalize every word and remove all spaces, e.g. `DesertEagle`, `StyleGuide`, `ASeriesOfWords`.
>
> ###### camelCase
>
> The first letter is always lowercase but every following word starts with uppercase, e.g. `desertEagle`, `styleGuide`, `aSeriesOfWords`.
>
> ###### Snake_case
>
> Words can arbitrarily start upper or lowercase but words are separated by an underscore, e.g. `desert_Eagle`, `Style_Guide`, `a_Series_of_Words`.

<a name="terms-var-prop"></a>
##### Variables / Properties

The words 'variable' and 'property' in most contexts are interchangable. If they are both used together in the same context however:

<a name="terms-property"></a>
###### Property
Usually refers to a variable defined in a class. For example, if `BP_Barrel` had a variable `bExploded`, `bExploded` may be referred to as a property of `BP_Barrel`.

When in the context of a class, it is often used to imply accessing previously defined data.

<a name="terms-variable"></a>
###### Variable
Usually refers to a variable defined as a function argument or a local variable inside a function.

When in the context of a class, it is often used to convey discussion about its definition and what it will hold.

## 0. Principles

These principles have been adapted from [idomatic.js style guide](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js/).

<a name="0.1"></a>
### 0.1 If your UE4 project already has a style guide, you should follow it

If you are working on a project or with a team that has a pre-existing style guide, it should be respected.  Any inconsistency between an existing style guide and this guide should defer to the existing.

Style guides should be living documents. You should propose style guide changes to an existing style guide as well as this guide if you feel the change benefits all usages.

> #### "Arguments over style are pointless. There should be a style guide, and you should follow it."
> [_Rebecca Murphey_](https://rmurphey.com)

<a name="0.2"></a>
### 0.2 All structure, assets, and code in any Unreal Engine 4 project should look like a single person created it, no matter how many people contributed

Moving from one project to another should not cause a re-learning of style and structure. Conforming to a style guide removes unneeded guesswork and ambiguities.

It also allows for more productive creation and maintenance as one does not need to think about style. Simply follow the instructions. This style guide is written with best practices in mind, meaning that by following this style guide you will also minimize hard to track issues.

<a name="0.3"></a>
### 0.3 Friends do not let friends have bad style

If you see someone working either against a style guide or no style guide, try to correct them.

When working within a team or discussing within a community such as [Unreal Slackers](http://join.unrealslackers.org/), it is far easier to help and to ask for help when people are consistent. Nobody likes to help untangle someone's Blueprint spaghetti or deal with assets that have names they can't understand.

If you are helping someone whose work conforms to a different but consistent and sane style guide, you should be able to adapt to it. If they do not conform to any style guide, please direct them here.

<a name="0.4"></a>
### 0.4 A team without a style guide is no team of mine

When joining an Unreal Engine 4 team, one of your first questions should be "Do you have a style guide?". If the answer is no, you should be skeptical about their ability to work as a team.

<a name="0.5"></a>
### 0.5 Don't Break The Law

Gamemakin LLC is not a lawyer, but please don't introduce illegal actions and behavior to a project, including but not limited to:

* Don't distribute content you don't have the rights to distribute
* Don't infringe on someone else's copyrighted or trademark material
* Don't steal content
* Follow licensing restrictions on content, e.g. attribute when attributions are needed

<a name="00"></a>
## 00. 全局强制意见 Globally Enforced Opinions

@TODO: Make this section 1 and update this document accordingly. Or maybe we don't?

<a name="00.1"></a>
### 00.1 禁止使用的字符 Forbidden Characters

<a name="identifiers-1"></a>
#### 标识符

在任何类型的`标识符`中，除非绝对强制，否则**永远不要**使用以下字符:

* 任何形式的空格 
* 反斜杠 `\` 
* 特殊符号 例如: `#!@$%` 
* 任何Unicode字符 

任何类型的`标识符`在可能的情况下,都应尽量只包含一下字符:

* ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
* abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
* 1234567890
* _ (sparingly)

这样做的理由是，这能确保跨所有平台、所有工具的所有数据的最大兼容性，并有助于防止由于您无法控制的代码中标识符的潜在错误字符处理而导致中断。

## 1. 资产命名约定

命名约定应当视为法律. 一个符合命名约定的项目能够非常轻松地管理、搜索、解析和维护其资产。

Naming conventions should be treated as law. A project that conforms to a naming convention is able to have its assets managed, searched, parsed, and maintained with incredible ease.

大多数东西都有前缀，前缀通常是资产类型的首字母缩略词，后跟一个下划线。

Most things are prefixed with prefixes being generally an acronym of the asset type followed by an underscore.

<a name="base-asset-name"></a>
<a name="1.1"></a>

### 1.1 命名格式 - `Prefix_BaseAssetName_Variant_Suffix` - `前缀_基础命名_扩展名_后缀`

所有资产都应有一个 _基础命名_. 基础命名代表了关联资产的逻辑分组.属于这个逻辑分组的资产都应该遵守这个标准: `前缀_基础命名_扩展名_后缀`

All assets should have a _Base Asset Name_. A Base Asset Name represents a logical grouping of related assets. Any asset that is part of this logical group should follow the standard of  `Prefix_BaseAssetName_Variant_Suffix`.

遵守`前缀_基础命名_扩展名_后缀`模式并且在大脑中形成条件反射,通常就足以保证良好的资产名称. 以下是关于每个元素的一些详细规则.

Keeping the pattern `Prefix_BaseAssetName_Variant_Suffix` and in mind and using common sense is generally enough to warrant good asset names. Here are some detailed rules regarding each element.

`前缀`和`后缀`根据资产类型通过下面的[资产命名表](#asset-name-modifiers)确定

`Prefix` and `Suffix` are to be determined by the asset type through the following [Asset Name Modifier](#asset-name-modifiers) tables.

`基础命名` 应该使用简短而便于识别的词汇. 例如,如果你有一个名字叫做Bob,那么所有和Bob相关的资源的`基础命名`都应该叫做`Bob`

`BaseAssetName` should be determined by a short and easily recognizable name related to the context of this group of assets. For example, if you had a character named Bob, all of Bob's assets would have the `BaseAssetName` of `Bob`.

`扩展名(Variant)` 用来保证资源的唯一性,同样,`扩展名(Variant)`也应该是简短而容易理解的短词,以说明该资源在所属的资源逻辑组中的子集.例如, 如果Bob有多套皮肤,那么这些皮肤资源都应该使用`Bob`作为 `基础命名`的同时再包含`扩展名(Variant)`. 例如 'Evil'类型的皮肤资源, 名字应该是`Bob_Evil`. 而 'Retro'类型的皮肤应该是用`Bob_Retro`

For unique and specific variations of assets, `Variant` is either a short and easily recognizable name that represents logical grouping of assets that are a subset of an asset's base name. For example, if Bob had multiple skins these skins should still use `Bob` as the `BaseAssetName` but include a recognizable `Variant`. An 'Evil' skin would be referred to as `Bob_Evil` and a 'Retro' skin would be referred to as `Bob_Retro`.

一般来说, 如果仅仅是为了保证资源的唯一性, `扩展名(Variant)`可以使用从`01`开始的两位数字来表示. 例如, 如果你要制作一堆环境中使用的石头资源, 那么他们应该命名为`Rock_01`, `Rock_02`, `Rock_03`等等. 除非特殊需要, 不要让数字超过三位数. 如果你真的需要超过100个的资源序列,那么你应该考虑使用不同的`基础命名(BaseAssetName)`来组织他们,或者使用多个`扩展名(Variant)`

For unique but generic variations of assets, `Variant` is a two digit number starting at `01`. For example, if you have an environment artist generating nondescript rocks, they would be named `Rock_01`, `Rock_02`, `Rock_03`, etc. Except for rare exceptions, you should never require a three digit variant number. If you have more than 100 assets, you should consider organizing them with different base names or using multiple variant names.

基于你所制作的资产扩展属性, 你可以把多个扩展名串联起来. 例如, 如果你再制作一套地板所使用的资源, 那么你的资源除了使用`Flooring`作为`基础命名`, 扩展名可以使用多个, 例如 `Flooring_Marble_01`, `Flooring_Maple_01`, `Flooring_Tile_Squares_01`.

Depending on how your asset variants are made, you can chain together variant names. For example, if you are creating flooring assets for an Arch Viz project you should use the base name `Flooring` with chained variants such as `Flooring_Marble_01`, `Flooring_Maple_01`, `Flooring_Tile_Squares_01`.

#### 1.2.6.1 Texture Packing
#### 1.2.6.1 纹理合并

把多张纹理存于一个纹理文件中是很常见的方法, 比如冗长可以把自发光(Emissive), 粗糙图(Roughness), 环境光(Ambient Occlusion)以TGB通道的形式保存在纹理中, 然后在文件的后缀中,注明这些信息, 例如`_EGO`

It is common practice to pack multiple layers of texture data into one texture. An example of this is packing Emissive, Roughness, Ambient Occlusion together as the Red, Green, and Blue channels of a texture respectively. To determine the suffix, simply stack the given suffix letters from above together, e.g. `_ERO`.

> 一般来说, 在纹理的Diffuse信息中附带Alpha/Opacity信息是很常见的, 这时在`_D`后缀中可以加入`A`也可以不加

> It is generally acceptable to include an Alpha/Opacity layer in your Diffuse/Albedo's alpha channel and as this is common practice, adding `A` to the `_D` suffix is optional.

不推荐同时把RGBA四个通道的信息保存在一张纹理中, 这是由于带有Alpha通道的纹理要不不带的暂用更多的资源, 除非Alpha信息是以蒙版(Mask)的形式保存在Diffuse/Albedo通道中.

Packing 4 channels of data into a texture (RGBA) is not recommended except for an Alpha/Opacity mask in the Diffuse/Albedo's alpha channel as a texture with an alpha channel incurs more overhead than one without.

## 2. Content 目录结构

对资源目录的规范管理和资源文件命名是同等重要的,都应该像法律一样被严格遵守. 不规范的目录结构会导致严重的混乱.

Equally important as asset names, the directory structure style of a project should be considered law. Asset naming conventions and content directory structure go hand in hand, and a violation of either causes unneeded chaos.

有多种不同管理UE4资产目录的方法, 在本套规范中, 我们尽量利用了UE4的资产浏览器的过滤和搜索功能来查找资源, 而不是按照资产类型来划分目录结构.

There are multiple ways to lay out the content of a UE4 project. In this style, we will be using a structure that relies more on filtering and search abilities of the Content Browser for those working with assets to find assets of a specific type instead of another common structure that groups asset types with folders.
> 如果你正确遵守了前面使用前缀的资产[命名约定](#1.2), 那么久没有必要按照资源类型创建类似于`Meshs`,`Textures`,`Materials`这样的目录结构, 因为你可以在过滤器中通过前缀来找到特定类型的资源

> If you are using the prefix [naming convention](#1.2) above, using folders to contain assets of similar types such as `Meshes`, `Textures`, and `Materials` is a redundant practice as asset types are already both sorted by prefix as well as able to be filtered in the content browser.

</pre>

The reasons for this structure are listed in the following sub-sections.
使用这种目录结构的原因如下

<a name="2.1"></a>
<a name="structure-folder-names"><a>
### 2.1 文件夹命名

关于文件夹的命名,有一些通用的规范

These are common rules for naming any folder in the content structure.

<a name="2.1.1"></a>
#### 2.1.1 使用帕斯卡命名规范大小写 [<sup>*</sup>](#terms-cases)
#### 2.1.1 Always Use PascalCase[<sup>*</sup>](#terms-cases)

文件夹的命名需要遵守 `PascalCase`规范, 也就是所有单词的首字母大写, 并且中间没有任何连接符. 例如`DesertEagle`, `RocketPistol`, `ASeriesOfWords`

PascalCase refers to starting a name with a capital letter and then instead of using spaces, every following word also starts with a capital letter. For example, `DesertEagle`, `RocketPistol`, and `ASeriesOfWords`.

参照 [大小写规范](#terms-cases).

See [Cases](#terms-cases).

<a name="2.1.2"></a>
#### 2.1.2 不要使用空格
#### 2.1.2 Never Use Spaces

作为对[2.1.1](#2.1.1)的补充, 绝对不要在目录名中使用空格. 空格会导致引擎及其他命令行工具出现错误. 同样,也不要把工程放在包含有空格的目录虾米那. 应该放在类似于`D:\Project`这样的目录里, 而不是 `C:\Users\My Name\My Documents\Unreal Projects`.

Re-enforcing [2.1.1](#2.1.1), never use spaces. Spaces can cause various engineering tools and batch processes to fail. Ideally, your project's root also contains no spaces and is located somewhere such as `D:\Project` instead of `C:\Users\My Name\My Documents\Unreal Projects`.

<a name="2.1.3"></a>
#### 2.1.3 不要使用Unicode字符或特殊符号
#### 2.1.3 Never Use Unicode Characters And Other Symbols

如果在你的游戏里有一个角色叫`Zoë`, 那么他的文件夹名称应该是`Zoe`, Unicode字符是比[空格](#2.1.2)更加严重错误, 因为UE4的引擎工具在设计时根本据没考虑过这种情况

If one of your game characters is named 'Zoë', its folder name should be `Zoe`. Unicode characters can be worse than [Spaces](#2.1.2) for engineering tool and some parts of UE4 don't support Unicode characters in paths either.

顺便说一句, 如果你的工程碰到了类似于 [这篇帖子](https://answers.unrealengine.com/questions/101207/undefined.html)中的情况, 并且当前使用的系统用户名包含有Unicode字符. 那么只要把工程从`My Documents`目录移到`D:\Project`这种简单的目录里就可以解决了.

Related to this, if your project has [unexplained issues](https://answers.unrealengine.com/questions/101207/undefined.html) and your computer's user name has a Unicode character (i.e. your name is `Zoë`), any project located in your `My Documents` folder will suffer from this issue. Often simply moving your project to something like `D:\Project` will fix these mysterious issues.

记住永远在目录名中只使用`a-z`, `A-Z`, 和 `0-9`这些标准字符.如果使用了类似于`@`, `-`, `_`, `,`, `*`, 和 `#`这样的字符, 难免会碰到一些操作系统,源码管理工具或者一些弱智的工具让你吃个大亏.

Using other characters outside `a-z`, `A-Z`, and `0-9` such as `@`, `-`, `_`, `,`, `*`, and `#` can also lead to unexpected and hard to track issues on other platforms, source control, and weaker engineering tools.

<a name="2.2"></a>
<a name="structure-top-level"><a>

### 2.2 使用一个顶级目录来保存所有工程资源 

### 2.2 Use A Top Level Folder For Project Specific Assets

所有的工程资源都应该保存在一个以工程名命名的目录中。例如你有一个工程叫做'Generic Shooter'，那么所有该工程的资源都应该保存在`Content/GenericShooter`目录中。

All of a project's assets should exist in a folder named after the project. For example, if your project is named 'Generic Shooter', _all_ of it's content should exist in `Content/GenericShooter`.

> 开发者目录`Developers`不用受此限制，因为开发者资源是跨工程使用的，参照下面的[开发者目录](#2.3)中的详细说明。

> The `Developers` folder is not for assets that your project relies on and therefore is not project specific. See [Developer Folders](#2.3) for details about this.

使用顶级目录的原因有很多。

There are multiple reasons for this approach.

<a name="2.2.1"></a>

#### 2.2.1 避免全局资源

#### 2.2.1 No Global Assets

通常在代码规范中会警告你不要使用全局变量以避免污染全局命名空间。基于同样的道理，不存在于工程目录中的资源对于资源管理会造成不必要的干扰。

Often in code style guides it is written that you should not pollute the global namespace and this follows the same principle. When assets are allowed to exist outside of a project folder, it often becomes much harder to enforce a strict structure layout as assets not in a folder encourages the bad behavior of not having to organize assets.

每个属于项目资源都应该有它存在的目的。如果仅仅是为了测试或者体验而使用的资源，那么这些资源应该放在[`开发者`](#2.3)目录中。

Every asset should have a purpose, otherwise it does not belong in a project. If an asset is an experimental test and shouldn't be used by the project it should be put in a [`Developer`](#2.3) folder.

<a name="2.2.2"></a>

#### 2.2.2 减少资源迁移时的冲突

#### 2.2.2 Reduce Migration Conflicts

当一个团队有多个项目时，从一个项目中把资源拷贝到另一个项目会非常频繁，这时最方便的方法就是使用引擎的资源浏览器提供的Migrate功能，因为这个功能会把资源的依赖项一起拷贝到目标项目中。

When working on multiple projects it is common for a team to copy assets from one project to another if they have made something useful for both. When this occurs, the easiest way to perform the copy is to use the Content Browser's Migrate functionality as it will copy over not just the selected asset but all of its dependencies.

这些依赖项经常造成麻烦。如果两个工程没有项目顶级目录，那么这些依赖项很容易就会被拷贝过来的同名资源覆盖掉，从而造成意外的更改。

These dependencies are what can easily get you into trouble. If two project's assets do not have a top level folder and they happen to have similarly named or already previously migrated assets, a new migration can accidentally wipe any changes to the existing assets.

这也是为什么EPIC会强制要求商城中出售的资源要遵守同样的规定的原因

This is also the primary reason why Epic's Marketplace staff enforces the same policy for submitted assets.

执行完Migrate资源拷贝后，安全的资源合并方法是使用资源浏览器中的'替换引用'(Replace References)工具，把不属于工程目录中的资源引用替换掉。一旦资源资源完成完整的合并流程，工程目录中不应该存在另一个工程的顶级目录。这种方法可以_100%_保证资源合并的安全性。

After a migration, safe merging of assets can be done using the 'Replace References' tool in the content browser with the added clarity of assets not belonging to a project's top level folder are clearly pending a merge. Once assets are merged and fully migrated, there shouldn't be another top level folder in your Content tree. This method is _100%_ guaranteed to make any migrations that occur completely safe.

<a name="2.2.2e1"></a>

##### 2.2.2e1 举例：基础材质的麻烦


##### 2.2.2e1 Master Material Example

举个例子，你在一个工程中创建了一个基础材质，然后你把这个材质迁移到了另一个工程中。如果你的资源结构中没有顶级目录的设计，那么这个基础材质可能放在`Content/MaterialLibrary/M_Master`这样的目录中，如果目标工程原本没有这个材质，那么很幸运暂时不会有麻烦。



For example, say you created a master material in one project that you would like to use in another project so you migrated that asset over. If this asset is not in a top level folder, it may have a name like `Content/MaterialLibrary/M_Master`. If the target project doesn't have a master material already, this should work without issue.

随着两个工程的推进，有可能这个基础材质因工程的需求不同而发生了不同的修改。

As work on one or both projects progress, their respective master materials may change to be tailored for their specific projects due to the course of normal development.

问题出现在，其中一个项目的美术制作了一个非常不错的模型资源，另一个项目的美术想拿过来用。而这个资源使用了`Content/MaterialLibrary/M_Master`这个材质，那么当迁移这个模型时，`Content/MaterialLibrary/M_Master`这个资源就会出现冲突。

The issue comes when, for example, an artist for one project created a nice generic modular set of static meshes and someone wants to include that set of static meshes in the second project. If the artist who created the assets used material instances based on `Content/MaterialLibrary/M_Master` as they're instructed to, when a migration is performed there is a great chance of conflict for the previously migrated `Content/MaterialLibrary/M_Master` asset.

这种冲突难以解决也难以预测，迁移资源的人可能压根就不熟悉工程所依赖的材质是同一个人开发的，也不清楚所依赖的资源已经发生了冲突，迁移资源必须同时拷贝资源依赖项，所以`Content/MaterialLibrary/M_Master`就被莫名其妙覆盖了。

This issue can be hard to predict and hard to account for. The person migrating the static meshes may not be the same person who is familiar with the development of both project's master material, and they may not be even aware that the static meshes in question rely on material instances which then rely on the master material. The Migrate tool requires the entire chain of dependencies to work however, and so it will be forced to grab `Content/MaterialLibrary/M_Master` when it copies these assets to the other project and it will overwrite the existing asset.

和这种情况类似，任何资源的依赖项的不兼容都会让资源在迁移中被破坏掉，如果没有资源顶级目录，资源迁移就会变成一场非常让人恶心的任务。

It is at this point where if the master materials for both projects are incompatible in _any way_, you risk breaking possibly the entire material library for a project as well as any other dependencies that may have already been migrated, simply because assets were not stored in a top level folder. The simple migration of static meshes now becomes a very ugly task.

<a name="2.2.3"></a>

#### 2.2.3 范例，模板以及商场中的资源都是安全没有风险的
#### 2.2.3 Samples, Templates, and Marketplace Content Are Risk-Free

正如上面[2.2.2](#2.2.2)所讲，如果一个团队想把官方范例、模板以及商城中购买的资源放到自己的工程中，那么这些资源都是可以保证不会干扰现有工程的，除非你购买的资源工程和你的工程同名。


An extension to [2.2.2](#2.2.2), if a team member decides to add sample content, template files, or assets they bought from the marketplace, it is guaranteed, as long your project's top-level folder is uniquely named,that these new assets will not interfere with your project.

当然也不能完全信任商城上的资源能够完全遵守[顶级目录规则](#2.2)。的确有一些商城资源，尽管大部分资源放在了顶级目录下面，但仍然留下了部分资源污染了`Content`目录


You can not trust marketplace content to fully conform to the [top level folder rule](#2.2). There exists many assets that have the majority of their content in a top level folder but also have possibly modified Epic sample content as well as level files polluting the global `Content` folder.

如果坚持这个原则[2.2](#2.2)，最糟糕的情况就是购买了两个不同的商场资源，结果发现他们使用了相同的EPIC的示例资源。但只要你坚持把自己的资源放在自己的工程目录中，并且把使用的EPIC示例资源也放在自己的目录中，那么自己工程也不会受到影响。


When adhering to [2.2](#2.2), the worst marketplace conflict you can have is if two marketplace assets both have the same Epic sample content. If all your assets are in a project specific folder, including sample content you may have moved into your folder, your project will never break.

<a name="2.2.4"></a>

#### 2.2.4 容易维护DLC、子工程、以及补丁包

#### 2.2.4 DLC, Sub-Projects, and Patches Are Easily Maintained

如果你的工程打算开发DLC或者子工程，那么这些子工程所需要的资源应该迁移出来放在另一个顶级目录中，这样的结构使得编译这些版本时可以区别对待子工程中的资源。子工程中的资源的迁入和迁出代价也更小。如果你想在子项目中修改一些原有工程中的资源，那么可以把这些资源迁移到子工程目录中，这样不会破坏原有工程。

If your project plans to release DLC or has multiple sub-projects associated with it that may either be migrated out or simply not cooked in a build, assets relating to these projects should have their own separate top level content folder. This make cooking DLC separate from main project content far easier. Sub-projects can also be migrated in and out with minimal effort. If you need to change a material of an asset or add some very specific asset override behavior in a patch, you can easily put these changes in a patch folder and work safely without the chance of breaking the core project.

### 2.3 用来做临时测试的开发者目录

### 2.3 Use Developers Folder For Local Testing

在一个项目的开发期间，团队成员经常会有一个'沙箱'目录用来做测试而不会影响到工程本身。因为工作是连续的，所以即使这些'沙箱'目录也需要上传到源码服务器上保存。但并不是所有团队成员都需要这种开发者目录的，但使用开发者目录的成员来说，一旦这些目录是在服务器上管理的，总会遇到一些麻烦事。

During a project's development, it is very common for team members to have a sort of 'sandbox' where they can experiment freely without risking the core project. Because this work may be ongoing, these team members may wish to put their assets on a project's source control server. Not all teams require use of Developer folders, but ones that do use them often run into a common problem with assets submitted to source control.

首先团队成员极容易使用这些尚未准备好的资源，这些资源一旦被删除就会引发问题。例如一个做模型的美术正在调整一个模型资源，这时一个做场景编辑的美术如果在场景中使用了这个模型，那么很可能会导致莫名其妙的问题，进而造成大量的工作浪费。


It is very easy for a team member to accidentally use assets that are not ready for use, which will cause issues once those assets are removed. For example, an artist may be iterating on a modular set of static meshes and still working on getting their sizing and grid snapping correct. If a world builder sees these assets in the main project folder, they might use them all over a level not knowing they could be subject to incredible change and/or removal. This causes massive amounts of re-working for everyone on the team to resolve.

但如果这些模型放在开发者目录中，那么场景美术人员就没有任何理由使用这些资源。资源浏览器的缺省设置会自动过滤掉这个目录，从而保证正常情况下不可能出现被误用的情况。


If these modular assets were placed in a Developer folder, the world builder should never have had a reason to use them and the whole issue would never happen. The Content Browser has specific View Options that will hide Developer folders (they are hidden by default) making it impossible to accidentally use Developer assets under normal use.

一旦这些资源真正准备好，那么美术人员应该把它们移到正式的工程目录中并修复引用关系，这实际上是让资源从实验阶段'推进'到了生产阶段。


Once the assets are ready for use, an artist simply has to move the assets into the project specific folder and fix up redirectors. This is essentially 'promoting' the assets from experimental to production.

### 2.4 所有的地图[<sup>*</sup>](#terms-level-map)文件应该保存在一个名为'Maps'的目录中

### 2.4 All Map[<sup>*</sup>](#terms-level-map) Files Belong In A Folder Called Maps

地图文件非常特殊，几乎所有工程都有自己的一套关于地图的命名规则，尤其是使用了sub-levels或者streaming levels技术时。但不管你如何组织自己的命名规则，都应该把所有地图保存在`/Content/Project/Maps`


Map files are incredibly special and it is common for every project to have its own map naming system, especially if they work with sub-levels or streaming levels. No matter what system of map organization is in place for the specific project, all levels should belong in `/Content/Project/Maps`.

记住，尽量使用不浪费大家的时间的方法去解释你的地图如何打开。比如通过子目录的方法去组织地图资源，例如建立 `Maps/Campaign1/` 或 `Maps/Arenas`，但最重要的是一定要都放在`/Content/Project/Maps`


Being able to tell someone to open a specific map without having to explain where it is is a great time saver and general 'quality of life' improvement. It is common for levels to be within sub-folders of `Maps`, such as `Maps/Campaign1/` or `Maps/Arenas`, but the most important thing here is that they all exist within `/Content/Project/Maps`.

这也有助于产品的打版本工作，如果工程里的地图保存的到处都是，版本工程师还要到处去找，就让人很恼火了，而把地图放在一个地方，做版本时就很难漏掉某个地图，对于烘培光照贴图或者质量检查都有利。


This also simplifies the job of cooking for engineers. Wrangling levels for a build process can be extremely frustrating if they have to dig through arbitrary folders for them. If a team's maps are all in one place, it is much harder to accidentally not cook a map in a build. It also simplifies lighting build scripts as well as QA processes.

<a name="2.5"></a>
<a name="structure-core"></a>

### 2.5 不要创建名为`Assets` 或者 `AssetTypes`的目录

### 2.5 Use A `Core` Folder For Critical Blueprints And Other Assets

使用`/Content/Project/Core`这个目录用来保存一个工程中最为核心的资源。例如，非常基础的`GameMode`, `Character`, `PlayerController`, `GameState`, `PlayerState`，以及如此相关的一些资源也应该放在这里。

Use `/Content/Project/Core` folder for assets that are absolutely fundamental to a project's workings. For example, base `GameMode`, `Character`, `PlayerController`, `GameState`, `PlayerState`, and related Blueprints should live here.

这个目录非常明显的告诉其他团队成员:"不要碰我！"。非引擎程序员很少有理由去碰这个目录，如果工程目录结构合理，那么游戏设计师只需要使用子类提供的功能就可以工作，负责场景编辑的员工只需要使用专用的的蓝图就可以，而不用碰到这些基础类。


This creates a very clear "don't touch these" message for other team members. Non-engineers should have very little reason to enter the `Core` folder. Following good code structure style, designers should be making their gameplay tweaks in child classes that expose functionality. World builders should be using prefab Blueprints in designated folders instead of potentially abusing base classes.

例如，如果项目需要设计一种可以放置在场景中并且可以被捡起的物体，那么应该首先设计一个具有被捡起功能的基类放在`Core/Pickups`目录中，而各种具体的可以被捡起的物体诸如药瓶、子弹这样的物体，应该放在`/Content/Project/Placeables/Pickups/`这样的目录中。游戏设计师可以在这些目录中定义和设计这些物体，所以他们不应该去碰`Core/Pickups`目录下的代码，要不然可能无意中破坏工程中的其他功能

For example, if your project requires pickups that can be placed in a level, there should exist a base Pickup class in `Core/Pickups` that defines base behavior for a pickup. Specific pickups such as a Health or Ammo should exist in a folder such as `/Content/Project/Placeables/Pickups/`. Game designers can define and tweak pickups in this folder however they please, but they should not touch `Core/Pickups` as they may unintentionally break pickups project-wide.

### 2.6 不要创建名为`Assets` 或者 `AssetTypes`的目录

### 2.6 Do Not Create Folders Called `Assets` or `AssetTypes`

<a name="2.6.1"></a>

#### 2.6.1 创建一个名为`Assets`的目录是多余的。

#### 2.6.1 Creating a folder named `Assets` is redundant

因为本来所有目录就是用来保存资产的

All assets are assets.

<a name="2.6.2"></a>

#### 2.6.2 创建名为`Meshes`、 `Textures`或者`Materials`的目录是多余的。

#### 2.6.2 Creating a folder named `Meshes`, `Textures`, or `Materials` is redundant

资源的文件名本身已经提供了资源类型信息，所以在目录名中再提供资源类型信息就是多余了，而且使用资源浏览器的过滤功能，可以非常便利的提供相同的功能。


All asset names are named with their asset type in mind. These folders offer only redundant information and the use of these folders can easily be replaced with the robust and easy to use filtering system the Content Browser provides.

比如想查看`Environment/Rocks/`目录下所有的静态Mesh资源？只要打开静态Mesh过滤器就可以了，如果所有资源的文件名已经正确命名，这些文件还会按照文件名和前缀正确排序，如果想查看所有静态Mesh和带有骨骼的Mesh资源，只要打开这两个过滤器就可以了，这种方法要比通过打开关闭文件夹省事多了。

Want to view only static mesh in `Environment/Rocks/`? Simply turn on the Static Mesh filter. If all assets are named correctly, they will also be sorted in alphabetical order regardless of prefixes. Want to view both static meshes and skeletal meshes? Simply turn on both filters. This eliminates the need to potentially have to `Control-Click` select two folders in the Content Browser's tree view.

> 这种方法也能够节省路径长度，因为用前缀`S_`只有两个字符，要比使用`Meshes/`七个字符短多了。

> This also extends the full path name of an asset for very little benefit. The `S_` prefix for a static mesh is only two characters, whereas `Meshes/` is seven characters.

这么做其实也能防止有人把Mesh或者纹理放在`Materials`目录这种愚蠢行为。

Not doing this also prevents the inevitability of someone putting a static mesh or a texture in a `Materials` folder.

### 2.7 超大资源要有自己的目录结构

### 2.7 Very Large Asset Sets Get Their Own Folder Layout

这节可以视为针对[2.6](#2.6)的补充

This can be seen as a pseudo-exception to [2.6](#2.6).

有一些资源类型通常文件数量巨大，而且每个作用都不同。典型的例子是动画资源和声音资源。如果你发现有15个以上的资源属于同一个逻辑类型，那么它们应该被放在一起。


There are certain asset types that have a huge volume of related files where each asset has a unique purpose. The two most common are Animation and Audio assets. If you find yourself having 15+ of these assets that belong together, they should be together.

举例来说，角色共用的动画资源应该放在`Characters/Common/Animations`目录中，并且其中应该还有诸如`Locomotion` 或者`Cinematic`的子目录


For example, animations that are shared across multiple characters should lay in `Characters/Common/Animations` and may have sub-folders such as `Locomotion` or `Cinematic`.

> 这并不适用与纹理和材质。比如`Rocks`目录通常会包含数量非常多的纹理，但每个纹理都都是属于特定的石头的，它们应该被正确命名就足够了。即使这些纹理属于[材质库](#2.8)


> This does not apply to assets like textures and materials. It is common for a `Rocks` folder to have a large amount of textures if there are a large amount of rocks, however these textures are generally only related to a few specific rocks and should be named appropriately. Even if these textures are part of a [Material Library](#2.8).

<a name="2.8"></a>
<a name="structure-material-library"></a>


### 2.8 材质库`MaterialLibrary`

### 2.8 `MaterialLibrary`

如果你的工程中使用了任何基础材质、分层材质，或者任何被重复使用而不属于特定模型的材质和纹理，这些资源应该放在材质库目录`Content/Project/MaterialLibrary`。


If your project makes use of master materials, layered materials, or any form of reusable materials or textures that do not belong to any subset of assets, these assets should be located in `Content/Project/MaterialLibrary`.

这样可以很容易管理这些'全局'材质

This way all 'global' materials have a place to live and are easily located.

> 这也使得'只是用材质实例'这个原则得以执行的比较容易。如果所有的美术人员都只是用材质实例，那么所有的原始材质都应该保存在这个目录中。你可以通过搜索所有不在`MaterialLibrary`中的基础材质来验证这一点。


> This also makes it incredibly easy to enforce a 'use material instances only' policy within a project. If all artists and assets should be using material instances, then the only regular material assets that should exist are within this folder. You can easily verify this by searching for base materials in any folder that isn't the `MaterialLibrary`.

`MaterialLibrary`这个目录并不是仅能保存材质资源，一些共用的工具纹理、材质函数以及其他具有类似属性的资源都应该放在这个目录或子目录中。例如，噪声纹理应该保存在`MaterialLibrary/Utility`目录中。


The `MaterialLibrary` doesn't have to consist of purely materials. Shared utility textures, material functions, and other things of this nature should be stored here as well within folders that designate their intended purpose. For example, generic noise textures should be located in `MaterialLibrary/Utility`.

任何用来测试或调试的材质应该保存在`MaterialLibrary/Debug`中，这样当工程正式发布时，可以很容易把这些材质从删除，因为这些材质如果不删除，可能在最终产品中非常扎眼。


Any testing or debug materials should be within `MaterialLibrary/Debug`. This allows debug materials to be easily stripped from a project before shipping and makes it incredibly apparent if production assets are using them if reference errors are shown.

### 2.9 不要留下空文件夹

### 2.9 No Empty Folders

不应该有任何空文件夹,这会导致目录浏览器的混乱

There simply shouldn't be any empty folders. They clutter the content browser.

如果发现有无法删除的空文件夹,可以按照你流程来执行:
1. 确定你在使用版本管理
1. 立即修复项目的重定向器
1. 删除磁盘上目录里的所有文件
1. 关闭引擎
1. 确保修改信息提交到版本管理系统.
1. 打开引擎, 确认正常生效. 如果没有,则直接回滚提交. 找出出错的点,并且修复它,然后重新执行.
1. 确保空文件夹不在项目内.
1. 提交

If you find that the content browser has an empty folder you can't delete, you should perform the following:
1. Be sure you're using source control.
1. Immediately run Fix Up Redirectors on your project.
1. Navigate to the folder on-disk and delete the assets inside.
1. Close the editor.
1. Make sure your source control state is in sync (i.e. if using Perforce, run a Reconcile Offline Work on your content directory)
1. Open the editor. Confirm everything still works as expected. If it doesn't, revert, figure out what went wrong, and try again.
1. Ensure the folder is now gone.
1. Submit changes to source control.

## 3. Blueprints

This section will focus on Blueprint classes and their internals. When possible, style rules conform to [Epic's Coding Standard](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/Development/CodingStandard).

Remember: Blueprinting badly bears blunders, beware! (Phrase by [KorkuVeren](http://github.com/KorkuVeren))

<a name="3.1"></a>
<a name="bp-compiling"></a>
### 3.1 Compiling

All blueprints should compile with zero warnings and zero errors. You should fix blueprint warnings and errors immediately as they can quickly cascade into very scary unexpected behavior.

Do *not* submit broken blueprints to source control. If you must store them on source control, shelve them instead.

Broken blueprints can cause problems that manifest in other ways, such as broken references, unexpected behavior, cooking failures, and frequent unneeded recompilation. A broken blueprint has the power to break your entire game.

<a name="3.2"></a>
<a name="bp-vars"></a>
### 3.2 Variables

The words `variable` and `property` may be used interchangeably.

<a name="3.2.1"></a>
<a name="bp-var-naming"></a>
#### 3.2.1 Naming

<a name="3.2.1.1"></a>
<a name="bp-var-naming-nouns"></a>
##### 3.2.1.1 Nouns

All non-boolean variable names must be clear, unambiguous, and descriptive nouns.

<a name="3.2.1.2"></a>
<a name="bp-var-naming-case"></a>
##### 3.2.1.2 PascalCase

All non-boolean variables should be in the form of [PascalCase](#terms-cases).

<a name="3.2.1.2e"></a>
###### 3.2.1.2e Examples

* `Score`
* `Kills`
* `TargetPlayer`
* `Range`
* `CrosshairColor`
* `AbilityID`

<a name="3.2.1.3"></a>
<a name="bp-var-bool-prefix"></a>
##### 3.2.1.3 Boolean `b` Prefix

All booleans should be named in PascalCase but prefixed with a lowercase `b`.

Example: Use `bDead` and `bEvil`, **not** `Dead` and `Evil`.

UE4 Blueprint editors know not to include the `b` in user-friendly displays of the variable.

<a name="3.2.1.4"></a>
<a name="bp-var-bool-names"></a>
##### 3.2.1.4 Boolean Names

<a name="3.2.1.4.1"></a>
###### 3.2.1.4.1 General And Independent State Information

All booleans should be named as descriptive adjectives when possible if representing general information. Do not include words that phrase the variable as a question, such as `Is`. This is reserved for functions.

Example: Use `bDead` and `bHostile` **not** `bIsDead` and `bIsHostile`.

Try to not use verbs such as `bRunning`. Verbs tend to lead to complex states.

<a name="3.2.1.4.2"></a>
###### 3.2.1.4.2 Complex States

Do not to use booleans to represent complex and/or dependent states. This makes state adding and removing complex and no longer easily readable. Use an enumeration instead.

Example: When defining a weapon, do **not** use `bReloading` and `bEquipping` if a weapon can't be both reloading and equipping. Define an enumeration named `EWeaponState` and use a variable with this type named `WeaponState` instead. This makes it far easier to add new states to weapons.

Example: Do **not** use `bRunning` if you also need `bWalking` or `bSprinting`. This should be defined as an enumeration with clearly defined state names.

<a name="3.2.1.5"></a>
<a name="bp-vars-naming-context"></a>
##### 3.2.1.5 Considered Context

All variable names must not be redundant with their context as all variable references in Blueprint will always have context.

<a name="3.2.1.5e"></a>
###### 3.2.1.5e Examples

Consider a Blueprint called `BP_PlayerCharacter`.

**Bad**

* `PlayerScore`
* `PlayerKills`
* `MyTargetPlayer`
* `MyCharacterName`
* `CharacterSkills`
* `ChosenCharacterSkin`

All of these variables are named redundantly. It is implied that the variable is representative of the `BP_PlayerCharacter` it belongs to because it is `BP_PlayerCharacter` that is defining these variables.

**Good**

* `Score`
* `Kills`
* `TargetPlayer`
* `Name`
* `Skills`
* `Skin`

<a name="3.2.1.6"></a>
<a name="bp-vars-naming-atomic"></a>
##### 3.2.1.6 Do _Not_ Include Atomic Type Names

Atomic or primitive variables are variables that represent data in their simplest form, such as booleans, integers, floats, and enumerations.

Strings and vectors are considered atomic in terms of style when working with Blueprints, however they are technically not atomic.

> While vectors consist of three floats, vectors are often able to be manipulated as a whole, same with rotators.

> Do _not_ consider Text variables as atomic, they are secretly hiding localization functionality. The atomic type of a string of characters is `String`, not `Text`.

Atomic variables should not have their type name in their name.

Example: Use `Score`, `Kills`, and `Description` **not** `ScoreFloat`, `FloatKills`, `DescriptionString`.

The only exception to this rule is when a variable represents 'a number of' something to be counted _and_ when using a name without a variable type is not easy to read.

Example: A fence generator needs to generate X number of posts. Store X in `NumPosts` or `PostsCount` instead of `Posts` as `Posts` may potentially read as an Array of a variable type named `Post`.

<a name="3.2.1.7"></a>
<a name="bp-vars-naming-complex"></a>
##### 3.2.1.7 Do Include Non-Atomic Type Names

Non-atomic or complex variables are variables that represent data as a collection of atomic variables. Structs, Classes, Interfaces, and primitives with hidden behavior such as `Text` and `Name` all qualify under this rule.

> While an Array of an atomic variable type is a list of variables, Arrays do not change the 'atomicness' of a variable type.

These variables should include their type name while still considering their context.

If a class owns an instance of a complex variable, i.e. if a `BP_PlayerCharacter` owns a `BP_Hat`, it should be stored as the variable type as without any name modifications.

Example: Use `Hat`, `Flag`, and `Ability` **not** `MyHat`, `MyFlag`, and `PlayerAbility`.

If a class does not own the value a complex variable represents, you should use a noun along with the variable type.

Example: If a `BP_Turret` has the ability to target a `BP_PlayerCharacter`, it should store its target as `TargetPlayer` as when in the context of `BP_Turret` it should be clear that it is a reference to another complex variable type that it does not own.


<a name="3.2.1.8"></a>
<a name="bp-vars-naming-arrays"></a>
##### 3.2.1.8 Arrays

Arrays follow the same naming rules as above, but should be named as a plural noun.

Example: Use `Targets`, `Hats`, and `EnemyPlayers`, **not** `TargetList`, `HatArray`, `EnemyPlayerArray`.


<a name="3.2.2"></a>
<a name="bp-vars-editable"></a>
#### 3.2.2 Editable Variables

All variables that are safe to change the value of in order to configure behavior of a blueprint should be marked as `Editable`.

Conversely, all variables that are not safe to change or should not be exposed to designers should _not_ be marked as editable, unless for engineering reasons the variable must be marked as `Expose On Spawn`.

Do not arbitrarily mark variables as `Editable`.

<a name="3.2.2.1"></a>
<a name="bp-vars-editable-tooltips"></a>
##### 3.2.2.1 Tooltips

All `Editable` variables, including those marked editable just so they can be marked as `Expose On Spawn`, should have a description in their `Tooltip` fields that explains how changing this value affects the behavior of the blueprint.

<a name="3.2.2.2"></a>
<a name="bp-vars-editable-ranges"></a>
##### 3.2.2.2 Slider And Value Ranges

All `Editable` variables should make use of slider and value ranges if there is ever a value that a variable should _not_ be set to.

Example: A blueprint that generates fence posts might have an editable variable named `PostsCount` and a value of -1 would not make any sense. Use the range fields to mark 0 as a minimum.

If an editable variable is used in a Construction Script, it should have a reasonable Slider Range defined so that someone can not accidentally assign it a large value that could crash the editor.

A Value Range only needs to be defined if the bounds of a value are known. While a Slider Range prevents accidental large number inputs, an undefined Value Range allows a user to specify a value outside the Slider Range that may be considered 'dangerous' but still valid.

<a name="3.2.3"></a>
<a name="bp-vars-categories"></a>
#### 3.2.3 Categories

If a class has only a small number of variables, categories are not required.

If a class has a moderate amount of variables (5-10), all `Editable` variables should have a non-default category assigned. A common category is `Config`.

If a class has a large amount of variables, all `Editable` variables should be categorized into sub-categories using the category `Config` as the base category. Non-editable variables should be categorized into descriptive categories describing their usage.

> You can define sub-categories by using the pipe character `|`, i.e. `Config | Animations`.

Example: A weapon class set of variables might be organized as:

    |-- Config
    |    |-- Animations
    |    |-- Effects
    |    |-- Audio
    |    |-- Recoil
    |    |-- Timings
    |-- Animations
    |-- State
    |-- Visuals

<a name="3.2.4"></a>
<a name="bp-vars-access"></a>
#### 3.2.4 Variable Access Level

In C++, variables have a concept of access level. Public means any code outside the class can access the variable. Protected means only the class and any child classes can access this variable internally. Private means only this class and no child classes can access this variable.

Blueprints do not have a defined concept of protected access currently.

Treat `Editable` variables as public variables. Treat non-editable variables as protected variables.

<a name="3.2.4.1"></a>
<a name="bp-vars-access-private"></a>
##### 3.2.4.1 Private Variables

Unless it is known that a variable should only be accessed within the class it is defined and never a child class, do not mark variables as private. Until variables are able to be marked `protected`, reserve private for when you absolutely know you want to restrict child class usage.

<a name="3.2.5"></a>
<a name="bp-vars-advanced"></a>
#### 3.2.5 Advanced Display

If a variable should be editable but often untouched, mark it as `Advanced Display`. This makes the variable hidden unless the advanced display arrow is clicked.

To find the `Advanced Display` option, it is listed as an advanced displayed variable in the variable details list.

<a name="3.2.6"></a>
<a name="bp-vars-transient"></a>
#### 3.2.6 Transient Variables

Transient variables are variables that do not need to have their value saved and loaded and have an initial value of zero or null. This is useful for references to other objects and actors who's value isn't known until run-time. This prevents the editor from ever saving a reference to it, and speeds up saving and loading of the blueprint class.

Because of this, all transient variables should always be initialized as zero or null. To do otherwise would result in hard to debug errors.

<a name="3.2.7"></a>
<a name="bp-vars-config"></a>
#### 3.2.8 Config Variables

Do not use the `Config Variable` flag. This makes it harder for designers to control blueprint behavior. Config variables should only be used in C++ for rarely changed variables. Think of them as `Advanced Advanced Display` variables.

<a name="3.3"></a>
<a name="bp-functions"></a>
### 3.3 Functions, Events, and Event Dispatchers

This section describes how you should author functions, events, and event dispatchers. Everything that applies to functions also applies to events, unless otherwise noted.

<a name="3.3.1"></a>
<a name="bp-funcs-naming"></a>
#### 3.3.1 Function Naming

The naming of functions, events, and event dispatchers is critically important. Based on the name alone, certain assumptions can be made about functions. For example:

* Is it a pure function?
* Is it fetching state information?
* Is it a handler?
* Is it an RPC?
* What is its purpose?

These questions and more can all be answered when functions are named appropriately.

<a name="3.3.1.1"></a>
<a name="bp-funcs-naming-verbs"></a>
#### 3.3.1.1 All Functions Should Be Verbs

All functions and events perform some form of action, whether its getting info, calculating data, or causing something to explode. Therefore, all functions should all start with verbs. They should be worded in the present tense whenever possible. They should also have some context as to what they are doing.

`OnRep` functions, event handlers, and event dispatchers are an exception to this rule.

Good examples:

* `Fire` - Good example if in a Character / Weapon class, as it has context. Bad if in a Barrel / Grass / any ambiguous class.
* `Jump` - Good example if in a Character class, otherwise, needs context.
* `Explode`
* `ReceiveMessage`
* `SortPlayerArray`
* `GetArmOffset`
* `GetCoordinates`
* `UpdateTransforms`
* `EnableBigHeadMode`
* `IsEnemy` - ["Is" is a verb.](http://writingexplained.org/is-is-a-verb)

Bad examples:

* `Dead` - Is Dead? Will deaden?
* `Rock`
* `ProcessData` - Ambiguous, these words mean nothing.
* `PlayerState` - Nouns are ambiguous.
* `Color` - Verb with no context, or ambiguous noun.

<a name="3.3.1.2"></a>
<a name="bp-funcs-naming-onrep"></a>
#### 3.3.1.2 Property RepNotify Functions Always `OnRep_Variable`

All functions for replicated with notification variables should have the form `OnRep_Variable`. This is forced by the Blueprint editor. If you are writing a C++ `OnRep` function however, it should also follow this convention when exposing it to Blueprints.

<a name="3.3.1.3"></a>
<a name="bp-funcs-naming-bool"></a>
#### 3.3.1.3 Info Functions Returning Bool Should Ask Questions

When writing a function that does not change the state of or modify any object and is purely for getting information, state, or computing a yes/no value, it should ask a question. This should also follow [the verb rule](#bp-funcs-naming-verbs).

This is extremely important as if a question is not asked, it may be assumed that the function performs an action and is returning whether that action succeeded.

Good examples:

* `IsDead`
* `IsOnFire`
* `IsAlive`
* `IsSpeaking`
* `IsHavingAnExistentialCrisis`
* `IsVisible`
* `HasWeapon` - ["Has" is a verb.](http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/parts-of-speech/verbs/Helping-Verbs.html)
* `WasCharging` - ["Was" is past-tense of "be".](http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/parts-of-speech/verbs/Helping-Verbs.html) Use "was" when referring to 'previous frame' or 'previous state'.
* `CanReload` - ["Can" is a verb.](http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/parts-of-speech/verbs/Helping-Verbs.html)

Bad examples:

* `Fire` - Is on fire? Will fire? Do fire?
* `OnFire` - Can be confused with event dispatcher for firing.
* `Dead` - Is dead? Will deaden?
* `Visibility` - Is visible? Set visibility? A description of flying conditions?

<a name="3.3.1.4"></a>
<a name="bp-funcs-naming-eventhandlers"></a>
#### 3.3.1.4 Event Handlers and Dispatchers Should Start With `On`

Any function that handles an event or dispatches an event should start with `On` and continue to follow [the verb rule](#bp-funcs-naming-verbs). The verb may move to the end however if past-tense reads better.

[Collocations](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/grammar/british-grammar/about-words-clauses-and-sentences/collocation) of the word `On` are exempt from following the verb rule.

`Handle` is not allowed. It is 'Unreal' to use `On` instead of `Handle`, while other frameworks may prefer to use `Handle` instead of `On`.

Good examples:

* `OnDeath` - Common collocation in games
* `OnPickup`
* `OnReceiveMessage`
* `OnMessageRecieved`
* `OnTargetChanged`
* `OnClick`
* `OnLeave`

Bad examples:

* `OnData`
* `OnTarget`
* `HandleMessage`
* `HandleDeath`

<a name="3.3.1.5"></a>
<a name="bp-funcs-naming-rpcs"></a>
#### 3.3.1.5 Remote Procedure Calls Should Be Prefixed With Target

Any time an RPC is created, it should be prefixed with either `Server`, `Client`, or `Multicast`. No exceptions.

After the prefix, follow all other rules regarding function naming.

Good examples:

* `ServerFireWeapon`
* `ClientNotifyDeath`
* `MulticastSpawnTracerEffect`

Bad examples:

* `FireWeapon` - Does not indicate its an RPC of some kind.
* `ServerClientBroadcast` - Confusing.
* `AllNotifyDeath` - Use `Multicast`, never `All`.
* `ClientWeapon` - No verb, ambiguous.


<a name="3.3.2"></a>
<a name="bp-funcs-return"></a>
#### 3.3.2 All Functions Must Have Return Nodes

All functions must have return nodes, no exceptions.

Return nodes explicitly note that a function has finished its execution. In a world where blueprints can be filled with `Sequence`, `ForLoopWithBreak`, and backwards reroute nodes, explicit execution flow is important for readability, maintenance, and easier debugging.

The Blueprint compiler is able to follow the flow of execution and will warn you if there is a branch of your code with an unhandled return or bad flow if you use return nodes.

In situations like where a programmer may add a pin to a Sequence node or add logic after a for loop completes but the loop iteration might return early, this can often result in an accidental error in code flow. The warnings the Blueprint compiler will alert everyone of these issues immediately.

<a name="3.3.3"></a>
<a name="bp-graphs-funcs-node-limit"></a>
#### 3.3.3 No Function Should Have More Than 50 Nodes

Simply, no function should have more than 50 nodes. Any function this big should be broken down into smaller functions for readability and ease of maintenance.

The following nodes are not counted as they are deemed to not increase function complexity:

* Comment
* Route
* Cast
* Getting a Variable
* Breaking a Struct
* Function Entry
* Self

<a name="3.3.4"></a>
<a name="bp-graphs-funcs-description"></a>
#### 3.3.4 All Public Functions Should Have A Description

This rule applies more to public facing or marketplace blueprints, so that others can more easily navigate and consume your blueprint API.

Simply, any function that has an access specificer of Public should have its description filled out.

<a name="3.3.5"></a>
<a name="bp-graphs-funcs-plugin-category"></a>
#### 3.3.5 All Custom Static Plugin `BlueprintCallable` Functions Must Be Categorized By Plugin Name

If your project includes a plugin that defines `static` `BlueprintCallable` functions, they should have their category set to the plugin's name or a subset category of the plugin's name.

For example, `Zed Camera Interface` or `Zed Camera Interface | Image Capturing`.

<a name="3.4"></a>
<a name="bp-graphs"></a>
### 3.4 Blueprint Graphs

This section covers things that apply to all Blueprint graphs.

<a name="3.4.1"></a>
<a name="bp-graphs-spaghetti"></a>
#### 3.4.1 No Spaghetti

Wires should have clear beginnings and ends. You should never have to mentally untangle wires to make sense of a graph. Many of the following sections are dedicated to reducing spaghetti.

<a name="3.4.2"></a>
<a name="bp-graphs-align-wires"></a>
#### 3.4.2 Align Wires Not Nodes

Always align wires, not nodes. You can't always control the size and pin location on a node, but you can always control the location of a node and thus control the wires. Straight wires provide clear linear flow. Wiggly wires wear wits wickedly. You can straighten wires by using the Straighten Connections command with BP nodes selected. Hotkey: Q

Good example: The tops of the nodes are staggered to keep a perfectly straight white exec line.
![Aligned By Wires](https://github.com/Allar/ue5-style-guide/blob/main/images/bp-graphs-align-wires-good.png?raw=true "Aligned By Wires")

Bad Example: The tops of the nodes are aligned creating a wiggly white exec line.
![Bad](https://github.com/Allar/ue5-style-guide/blob/main/images/bp-graphs-align-wires-bad.png?raw=true "Wiggly")

Acceptable Example: Certain nodes might not cooperate no matter how you use the alignment tools. In this situation, try to minimize the wiggle by bringing the node in closer.
![Acceptable](https://github.com/Allar/ue5-style-guide/blob/main/images/bp-graphs-align-wires-acceptable.png?raw=true "Acceptable")

<a name="3.4.3"></a>
<a name="bp-graphs-exec-first-class"></a>
#### 3.4.3 White Exec Lines Are Top Priority

If you ever have to decide between straightening a linear white exec line or straightening data lines of some kind, always straighten the white exec line.

<a name="3.4.4"></a>
<a name="bp-graphs-block-comments"></a>
#### 3.4.4 Graphs Should Be Reasonably Commented

Blocks of nodes should be wrapped in comments that describe their higher-level behavior. While every function should be well named so that each individual node is easily readable and understandable, groups of nodes contributing to a purpose should have their purpose described in a comment block. If a function does not have many blocks of nodes and its clear that the nodes are serving a direct purpose in the function's goal, then they do not need to be commented as the function name and  description should suffice.

<a name="3.4.5"></a>
<a name="bp-graphs-cast-error-handling"></a>
#### 3.4.5 Graphs Should Handle Casting Errors Where Appropriate

If a function or event assumes that a cast always succeeds, it should appropriately report a failure in logic if the cast fails. This lets others know why something that is 'supposed to work' doesn't. A function should also attempt a graceful recover after a failed cast if it's known that the reference being casted could ever fail to be casted.

This does not mean every cast node should have its failure handled. In many cases, especially events regarding things like collisions, it is expected that execution flow terminates on a failed cast quietly.

<a name="3.4.6"></a>
<a name="bp-graphs-dangling-nodes"></a>
#### 3.4.6 Graphs Should Not Have Any Dangling / Loose / Dead Nodes

All nodes in all blueprint graphs must have a purpose. You should not leave dangling blueprint nodes around that have no purpose or are not executed.

## 4. Static Meshes

This section will focus on Static Mesh assets and their internals.

<a name="4.1"></a>
<a name="s-uvs"></a>
### 4.1 Static Mesh UVs

If Linter is reporting bad UVs and you can't seem to track it down, open the resulting `.log` file in your project's `Saved/Logs` folder for exact details as to why it's failing. I am hoping to include these messages in the Lint report in the future.

<a name="4.1.1"></a>
<a name="s-uvs-no-missing"></a>
#### 4.1.1 All Meshes Must Have UVs

Pretty simple. All meshes, regardless how they are to be used, should not be missing UVs.

<a name="4.1.2"></a>
<a name="s-uvs-no-overlapping"></a>
#### 4.1.2 All Meshes Must Not Have Overlapping UVs for Lightmaps

Pretty simple. All meshes, regardless how they are to be used, should have valid non-overlapping UVs.

<a name="4.2"></a>
<a name="s-lods"></a>
### 4.2 LODs Should Be Set Up Correctly

This is a subjective check on a per-project basis, but as a general rule any mesh that can be seen at varying distances should have proper LODs.

<a name="4.3"></a>
<a name="s-modular-snapping"></a>
### 4.3 Modular Socketless Assets Should Snap To The Grid Cleanly

This is a subjective check on a per-asset basis, however any modular socketless assets should snap together cleanly based on the project's grid settings.

It is up to the project whether to snap based on a power of 2 grid or on a base 10 grid. However if you are authoring modular socketless assets for the marketplace, Epic's requirement is that they snap cleanly when the grid is set to 10 units or bigger.

<a name="4.4"></a>
<a name="s-collision"></a>
### 4.4 All Meshes Must Have Collision

Regardless of whether an asset is going to be used for collision in a level, all meshes should have proper collision defined. This helps the engine with things such as bounds calculations, occlusion, and lighting. Collision should also be well-formed to the asset.

<a name="4.5"></a>
<a name="s-scaled"></a>
### 4.5 All Meshes Should Be Scaled Correctly

This is a subjective check on a per-project basis, however all assets should be scaled correctly to their project. Level designers or blueprint authors should not have to tweak the scale of meshes to get them to confirm in the editor. Scaling meshes in the engine should be treated as a scale override, not a scale correction.

### 5.1 No Spaces, Ever

As mentioned in [00.1 Forbidden Identifiers](#00), spaces and all white space characters are forbidden in identifiers. This is especially true for Niagara systems as it makes working with things significantly harder if not impossible when working with HLSL or other means of scripting within Niagara and trying to reference an identifier.

### 6.1 No Errors Or Warnings

All levels should load with zero errors or warnings. If a level loads with any errors or warnings, they should be fixed immediately to prevent cascading issues.

You can run a map check on an open level in the editor by using the console command "map check".

Please note: Linter is even more strict on this than the editor is currently, and will catch load errors that the editor will resolve on its own.

### 6.2 Lighting Should Be Built

It is normal during development for levels to occasionally not have lighting built. When doing a test/internal/shipping build or any build that is to be distributed however, lighting should always be built.

<a name="levels-no-visible-z-fighting"></a>
### 6.3 No Player Visible Z Fighting

Levels should not have any [z-fighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting) in all areas visible to the player.

### 6.4 Marketplace Specific Rules

If a project is to be sold on the UE4 Marketplace, it must follow these rules.

<a name="6.4.1"></a>
<a name="levels-mp-rules-overview"></a>
#### 6.4.1 Overview Level

If your project contains assets that should be visualized or demoed, you must have a map within your project that contains the name "Overview".

This overview map, if it is visualizing assets, should be set up according to [Epic's guidelines](http://help.epicgames.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2592186-marketplace-submission-guidelines-preparing-your-assets#Required%20Levels%20and%20Maps).

For example, `InteractionComponent_Overview`.

<a name="6.4.2"></a>
<a name="levels-mp-rules-demo"></a>
#### 6.4.2 Demo Level

If your project contains assets that should be demoed or come with some sort of tutorial, you must have a map within your project that contains the name "Demo". This level should also contain documentation within it in some form that illustrates how to use your project. See Epic's Content Examples project for good examples on how to do this.

If your project is a gameplay mechanic or other form of system as opposed to an art pack, this can be the same as your "Overview" map.

For example, `InteractionComponent_Overview_Demo`, `ExplosionKit_Demo`.

## 7. Textures

This section will focus on Texture assets and their internals.

<a name="7.1"></a>
<a name="textures-dimensions"></a>
### 7.1 Dimensions Are Powers of 2

All textures, except for UI textures, must have its dimensions in multiples of powers of 2. Textures do not have to be square.

For example, `128x512`, `1024x1024`, `2048x1024`, `1024x2048`, `1x512`.

<a name="7.2"></a>
<a name="textures-density"></a>
### 7.2 Texture Density Should Be Uniform

All textures should be of a size appropriate for their standard use case. Appropriate texture density varies from project to project, but all textures within that project should have a consistent density.

For example, if a project's texture density is 8 pixel per 1 unit, a texture that is meant to be applied to a 100x100 unit cube should be 1024x1024, as that is the closest power of 2 that matches the project's texture density.

<a name="7.3"></a>
<a name="textures-max-size"></a>
### 7.3 Textures Should Be No Bigger than 8192

No texture should have a dimension that exceeds 8192 in size, unless you have a very explicit reason to do so. Often, using a texture this big is simply just a waste of resources.

<a name="7.4"></a>
<a name="textures-group"></a>
### 7.4 Textures Should Be Grouped Correctly

Every texture has a Texture Group property used for LODing, and this should be set correctly based on its use. For example, all UI textures should belong in the UI texture group.
